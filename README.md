## 1. Description

This plugin allows you to log on with your Google account on iOS and Android.
You will not only get the email address of the user, but also stuff like their full name and gender.

## 3. Google+ API setup
To communicate with Google+ you need to do some tedious setup, sorry.

### iOS
To get your iOS API key, follow Step 1 of [this guide](https://developers.google.com/+/mobile/ios/getting-started)
[get a configuration file here](https://developers.google.com/mobile/add?platform=ios&cntapi=signin).
This `GoogleService-Info.plist` file contains the `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` you'll need during installation.

### Android
To configure Android, follow Step 1 of [this guide](https://developers.google.com/+/quickstart/android)

Make sure you execute the `keytool` steps as well or authentication will fail.

## 4. Installation (PhoneGap CLI / Cordova CLI)
This plugin is compatible with [Cordova Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman), compatible with [PhoneGap 3.0 CLI](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.0.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-line%20Interface_add_features), here's how it works with the CLI (backup your project first!):

Using the Cordova CLI and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-googleplus)
```
$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-googleplus --variable REVERSED_CLIENT_ID=myreversedclientid
$ cordova prepare
```

To fetch the latest version from GitHub, use
```
$ cordova plugin add https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-googleplus --variable REVERSED_CLIENT_ID=myreversedclientid
$ cordova prepare
```

GooglePlus.js is brought in automatically. There is no need to change or add anything in your html.

## 5. Installation (PhoneGap Build)
Add this to your config.xml:
```xml
<gap:plugin name="cordova-plugin-googleplus" source="npm">
  <param name="REVERSED_CLIENT_ID" value="myreversedclientid" />
</gap:plugin>
```

## 6. Usage
Check the [demo app](demo) to get you going quickly, or hurt yourself and follow these steps.

Note that none of these methods should be called before [`deviceready`](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/cordova_events_events.md.html#deviceready) has fired.

### isAvailable
You'll want to check this before showing a 'Sign in with Google+' button.

On iOS it will check whether or not the Google+ app is installed. If it's not and you invoke the `login` function,
your app will redirect to Safari [which seems an app rejection reason these days](https://code.google.com/p/google-plus-platform/issues/detail?id=900).

On Android it will check whether or not Google Play Services is available. It's more likely than not that it is.

```javascript
window.plugins.googleplus.isAvailable(
    function (available) {
      if (available) {
        // show the Google+ sign-in button
      }
    }
);
```

### Login
```javascript
window.plugins.googleplus.login(
    {
      'scopes': '... ', // optional space-separated list of scopes, the default is sufficient for login and basic profile info
      'webApiKey': 'api of web app', // optional API key of your Web application from Credentials settings of your project - if you set it the returned idToken will allow sign in to services like Azure Mobile Services
      // there is no API key for Android; you app is wired to the Google+ API by listing your package name in the google dev console and signing your apk (which you have done in chapter 4)
    },
    function (obj) {
      alert(JSON.stringify(obj)); // do something useful instead of alerting
    },
    function (msg) {
      alert('error: ' + msg);
    }
);
```

Note that if you're only targeting Android you can pass `{}` for the first argument.

The success callback (second argument) gets a JSON object with the following contents, with example data of my Google+ account:
```javascript
 obj.email        // 'eddyverbruggen@gmail.com'
 obj.userId       // user id
 obj.displayName  // 'Eddy Verbruggen'
 obj.gender       // 'male' (other options are 'female' and 'unknown'
 obj.imageUrl     // 'http://link-to-my-profilepic.google.com'
 obj.givenName    // 'Eddy'
 obj.middleName   // null (or undefined, depending on the platform)
 obj.familyName   // 'Verbruggen'
 obj.birthday     // '1977-04-22'
 obj.ageRangeMin  // 21 (or null or undefined or a different number)
 obj.ageRangeMax  // null (or undefined or a number)
 obj.idToken
 obj.oauthToken
```

### Try silent login
When the user comes back to your app and you're not sure if he needs to log in,
you can call `trySilentLogin` to try logging him in.

If it succeeds you will get the same object as the `login` function gets,
but if it fails it will not show the authentication dialog to the user.

The code is exactly the same a `login`, except for the function name.
```javascript
window.plugins.googleplus.trySilentLogin(
    {
      'webApiKey': 'api of web app', // optional API key of your Web application from Credentials settings of your project - if you set it the returned idToken will allow sign in to services like Azure Mobile Services 
    },
    function (obj) {
      alert(JSON.stringify(obj)); // do something useful instead of alerting
    },
    function (msg) {
      alert('error: ' + msg);
    }
);
```

### logout
This will clear the OAuth2 token.
``` javascript
window.plugins.googleplus.logout(
    function (msg) {
      alert(msg); // do something useful instead of alerting
    }
);
```

### disconnect
This will clear the OAuth2 token and forget which account was used to login.
On Android this will always force the user to authenticate the app again,
on iOS using logout seems to do the job already. Need to investigate this a bit more..
``` javascript
window.plugins.googleplus.disconnect(
    function (msg) {
      alert(msg); // do something useful instead of alerting
    }
);
```

## 7. Troubleshooting
- Q: After authentication I'm not redirected back to my app.
- A: You probably changed the bundle id of your app after installing this plugin. Make sure that (on iOS) the `CFBundleURLTypes` bit in your `.plist` file is the same as the actual bundle id originating from `config.xml`.

- Q: I can't get authentication to work on Android. And why is there no ANDROID API KEY?
- A: On Android you need to execute the `keytool` steps, see the installation instructions for details.
